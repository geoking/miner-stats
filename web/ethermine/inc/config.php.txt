// -------------------------
// --- REQUIRED SETTINGS ---
// -------------------------

// --- Encryption key for URLS ---
// Used to mask links and other private data configured within miner stats
// Set this to a random string of at least 20 characters
	$conf['key'] = 'x';

// --- Wallet/Account Address ---
// Used to pull stats from ethermine, as well as the etherium blockchain
// This is the same as "<Your_Ethereum_Address>" when configuring your miner
// on ethermine.org
	$conf['wallet'] = 'x';

// --- Payout settings ---
// Set the payout threshold here
	$conf['payout_threshold'] = 0.05;

// --- CSS Folder path ---
// Set the CSS folder path for the server here
	$conf['css_folder_path'] = "/css/custom.css";
	$conf['js_folder_path'] = "/js/";

// --- minerstat access code ---
// minerstat config access code and worker name
	$conf['ms_access_key'] = 'x';
	$conf['ms_worker_name'] = 'worker1';

// --- Timezone ---
// Set this to your timezone, so that "next eth" and other date/time related 
// statistics are calculated so they are relevant to you.
// To find your timezone see - http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php
	date_default_timezone_set('Europe/London'); 

// --- Cache File ---
// In the event that the Ethermine API returns no data, a local cache file
// is created and used.  No data is returned from the API query when there
// are too many requests being made.  Specify what you'd like your cache 
// file to be called.  This file will be readable from your webserver, so
// use a random name to maintain the obscurity of your mining wallet 
// address.
	$conf['cache_file'] = 'changeme.tmp';
	
// -------------------------
// --- OPTIONAL SETTINGS ---
// -------------------------

// Set the base FIAT currency (ISO 4217) you are interested in.  Currently 
// I have only created support for USD, EUR and GBP.  If you want others 
// adding let me know.

// Set the colour scheme of all elements using the bootstrap utility
// standards (info = blue, success = green, warning = yellow, danger = red).
