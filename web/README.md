# miner-stats
This folder consists of the web version of the mining stats apps, initially showing stats from ethermine and minerstat.

The base code for this folder has been loosely forked from https://github.com/hamlesh/ethermine-stats but a lot of code changes have happened since, including the addition of new coins and minerstat figures via their API.

To get started, simply input your own details into config.php.txt, get rid of the .txt extension and it should be good to go.
